I should write a C compiler in Rust

## Summary

It is my dream to make my own voxel engine similar to Minecraft and write it in Rust. My second 
dream is to work on the Linux Kernel, joining both Rust and C. Both are my favorite programming languages.

I made a simple ray tracer in Rust and can use an ECS.

In middle school I tinkered with Python for Deep Learning using TensorFlow and PyTorch and managed
to port a PyTorch model over to TensorFlow.

## Languages

- Rust
  I love the ease of use
  - want to make a game
  - WGPU is the future
  - currently used in linux kernel
  - can easily bind to C
- C
  - GCC gang
  - love the ability to shoot myself in the foot whether I want to or not
  - Using this language to learn computer science and to master programming
  - want to develop on Linux kernel
- Scheme
  - GNU Guile ftw
  - beginning to understand GNU Manuals
  - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is the way to go
  - it took me several months to reach page 100, I keep on rage quitting
    - 2 years later still not done
  - I am obnoxiosly good at this language now
- Nim
  - compiles to C
  - with or without garbage collecter
  - C bindings are a piece of cake
  - near Lisp macro power
- Zig
  - next evolution of C
  - easy binding to C
  - opinionated design, avoid C's shortfalls
