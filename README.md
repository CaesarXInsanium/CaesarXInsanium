I should write a C compiler in Rust

## Summary

It is my dream to make my own voxel engine similar to Minecraft and write it in Rust. My second 
dream is to work on the Linux Kernel, joining both Rust and C. Both are my favorite programming languages.

I made a simple ray tracer in Rust and can use an ECS.

In middle school I tinkered with Python for Deep Learning using TensorFlow and PyTorch and managed
to port a PyTorch model over to TensorFlow.

## Languages

- Rust
  - Love the ease of use
  - want to make a game
- C
  - GCC gang
  - love the ability to shoot myself in the foot wether I want to or not
  - Using this language to learn computer science and to master programming
  - want to develop on linux kernel
- Python
  - first language
  - was easy to learn but dynamic typing was not for me.

  - fell in love on first sight but is too slow for my liking.
- Linux: 2019-Present
  - Very comfortable in a POSIX compliant shell
  - I use Arch BTW
  - Debian and Nix OS are glorious too
- Tiling/Dynamic Window Managers
  - I literally cannot use a floating window manager any more
