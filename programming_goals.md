# Programming Goals

Tips for making things not boring

- Shake things up
- keep things fun
- keep track of progress
- share code

## Goals

In order of importance the three most important goals

- Minecraft Clone Using Graphics Programming
- Linux Kernel Module/Driver
- Text/Code Editor

### C Goals

- Linux kernel module
- Custom Linux kernel
- Minecraft clone using graphics library
  - OpenGL
  - Vulkan maybe?
- Learning programming

### Rust Goals

- Minecraft clone using WGPU
- Graphical text editor using Bevy
- simple game

## Progress

Here is the guide that I am using [Graphics Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/prographon/graphics-developer-roadmap)
and a book guide that also seems to be a guide on things to learn [Game Programmer](https://github.com/miloyip/game-programmer)

### Learning Progress

In progress things. Try to keep things here at a max of 3

- System's Programming
  - Computer Systems a Programmer's Perspective
- Graphics Programming
  - LearnWGPU
  - LearnOpenGL
- Algorithms and Data Structures
  - Algorithm Design Manual

Finished

- C
  - basic syntax
  - creating binary targets
  - creating library targets
  - meson build system
- Rust
  - basic syntax
- Python
  - basic syntax
  - Tensorflow/Pytorch
- Java
  - basic syntax? I need a refresher
- Lua
  - basic syntax
- Nim
  - basic syntax

## Simple Programs I have Achieved

- rotating triangle in rust
- simple ray tracer in rust
- ported PyTorch Models to use TensorFlow instead

## Things I am most lacking

- motivation to finish projects
- will power to break solve difficult problems
- Creativity for making program that I can be proud of
