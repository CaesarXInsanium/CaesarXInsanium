# Programming Goals

Tips for making things not boring

- Shake things up
- keep things fun
- keep track of progress
- share code

## Goals

In order of importance the three most important goals

- Minecraft Clone Using Graphics Programming
- Linux Kernel Module/Driver
- Text/Code Editor

### C Goals

- Linux kernel module
- Custom Linux kernel
- Minecraft clone using graphics library
  - OpenGL
  - Vulkan maybe?
- Learning programming

### Rust Goals

- Minecraft clone using WGPU
- Graphical text editor using Bevy
- simple game

## Progress

Here is the guide that I am using [Graphics Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/prographon/graphics-developer-roadmap)
and a book guide that also seems to be a guide on things to learn [Game Programmer](https://github.com/miloyip/game-programmer)

Here are the things that I need to focus on in order to get to my goal

- Platform
  - What sort of programs do I want to make?
  - What sort of problems do I want to solve?
- Language
  - what languages are used in my platform?
  - What is the industry standard?
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- problem-solving
- networking; interacting with other developers
- DevOps

### Focus Areas

#### Platform

- graphics programming
- Linux Kernel
- game engine development
- game development

#### Language

- C/C++
- Rust

#### Data Structures and Algorithms

- Algorithm Design Manual

### Learning Progress

In progress things. Try to keep things here at a max of 2

- Rust Programming
  - Rust In Action
  - Rust Book
- Algorithms and Data Structures
  - Art of Computer Programming
  - CLRS
  - Algorithm Design Manual
- Language Design and Implementation
  - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

On Hold

- Graphics Programming
  - LearnWGPU
  - LearnOpenGL
- Go Programming
- Linux Kernel Programming Guide
- Nim Programming
- System's Programming
  - Computer Systems a Programmer's Perspective
 
Experience

- C
  - basic syntax
  - creating binary targets
  - creating library targets
  - meson build system
- Rust
  - basic syntax
- Python
  - basic syntax
  - Tensorflow/Pytorch
- Java
  - basic syntax? I need a refresher
- Lua
  - basic syntax
- Nim
  - basic syntax

## Simple Programs I have Achieved

- rotating triangle in rust
- simple ray tracer in rust
- ported PyTorch Models to use TensorFlow instead
- floating cubes

## Things I am most lacking

- motivation to finish projects
- will power to break solve difficult problems
- Creativity for making program that I can be proud of
